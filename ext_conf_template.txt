'Maximum(+)' is the optimal method, but is the least compatible. 'Strong(+)' loses the javascript-dependent security-layer but stops caching of the plugin. If neither is acceptable, dropping protection to 'Basic(+)' effectively trades in token-per-request for token-per-cache/session and is the most compatible method. The plus-variants all require matching referrer-headers to work and increase randomization of tokens. If you're confident you don't need CSRF-protection, you can disable it altogether.
